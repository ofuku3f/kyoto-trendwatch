/**
 * <h1>Control API is a part of the Smart Extension API's</h1>
 * <p>
 * Some of our advanced accessories will support the Control API.
 * The Control API enables the Extension to take total control of the Accessory.
 * It gets control over the display, LEDs, vibrator, input events.
 * Because of this, only one Extension can run in this mode at a time.
 * </p>

 * <a name="Registration"></a>
 * <h3>Registration</h3>
 * <p>
 * Before an Control Extension can use an accessory, it must use the registration API
 * content provider to insert a record in the extension table. It must also register
 * information in the registration table. This must be done for each Host Application
 * that the Extension wants to interact with.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In order to find out what Host Applications are available and what capabilities they
 * support, the Extension should use the capability API.
 * </p>
 * <a name="Lifecycle"></a>
 * <h3>Extension lifecycle</h3>
 * <p>
 * After a successful registration the Extension can start communicating with the Host
 * Application. Since a Extension implementing this API takes complete control over the
 * accessory only one Extension can run at a time.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An Extension cannot just start executing whenever it wants, it needs to make sure that
 * no other Extension is running, therefore the Extension can only request to be started,
 * {@link Intents#CONTROL_START_REQUEST_INTENT}. When the Host Application is ready to give
 * control to the Extension it will send a {@link Intents#CONTROL_START_INTENT}, see figure
 * below.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <img src="../../../../../../../images/control_api_extension_lifecycle.png"
 * alt="Extension lifecycle" border="1" />
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When the Extension requests to start controlling the accessory the Host Application can
 * either accept the request and give control to the Extension, or if something is not right
 * the Host Application can send a {@link Intents#CONTROL_ERROR_INTENT}. See
 * {@link Intents#EXTRA_ERROR_CODE} for different error codes that the Host Application can send.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link Intents#CONTROL_RESUME_INTENT} is sent when the Extension is visible on the accessory.
 * From this point on the Extension controls everything, the Host Application just forwards the
 * information between the accessory and the Extension.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An Extension can also be paused, either if a high priority Extension needs to run for a
 * while or it the Host Application is in charge of the display state and the display is
 * turned off. In this case the Host Application sends a {@link Intents#CONTROL_PAUSE_INTENT}
 * to the Extension. This means that there is no point for the Extension to update the display
 * since it is either turned off or someone else has control over it. If the Extension would
 * break this rule and try to update the display anyway, the Host Application will ignore the
 * calls.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When the Extension is in a paused state it no longer has control over the display/LEDs/
 * vibrator/key events. As an example one could say that a telephony Extension has high priority.
 * E.g. when a random Extension is running and the user receives a phone call. We want to pause
 * the running Extension and let the telephony Extension display the caller id on the accessory
 * display. When the phone call ends the telephony Extension is done and the other Extension can
 * resume its running, it will then receive a {@link Intents#CONTROL_RESUME_INTENT}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When the {@link Intents#CONTROL_RESUME_INTENT} is sent from a Host Application the Extension is
 * once again in charge of everything.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When the user chooses to exit the Extension the Host Application will send a
 * {@link Intents#CONTROL_PAUSE_INTENT} followed by a {@link Intents#CONTROL_STOP_INTENT}.
 * From this point on the Host Application regains control.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the Extension would like to stop itself when running, like the telephony Extension, it can
 * send a {@link Intents#CONTROL_STOP_REQUEST_INTENT} to the Host Application. The Host Application
 * will then make sure to stop it and send a {@link Intents#CONTROL_STOP_INTENT}.
 * If the extension was not already paused the it will be paused before it is stopped and a
 * {@link Intents#CONTROL_PAUSE_INTENT} is sent before the {@link Intents#CONTROL_STOP_INTENT}.
 * In case another Extension has been paused it will be resumed.
 * </p>
 *
 * <a name="DisplayControl"></a>
 * <h3>Controlling the display</h3>
 * <p>
 * Extensions implementing this API have the possibility to control the state of the accessory
 * display.The display can be controlled via {@link Intents#CONTROL_SET_SCREEN_STATE_INTENT}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is important that you program your Extension so that it consumes as little power as possible,
 * both on the phone side and on the accessory. The accessory has a much smaller battery then the
 * phone so use this functionality with caution. When possible, let the Host Application take control
 * of the display state. That way you donâ€™t have to bother about the power consumption on the accessory.
 * You can do this by setting the display state to "Auto".
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * By default when your Extension starts the display state will be set to "Auto", which means that the
 * Host Application controls the on/off/dim behavior. If the Extension wants to control the display state
 * it must explicitly change the state.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the Extension controls the display state and you get a {@link Intents#CONTROL_STOP_INTENT}, meaning
 * your Extension is no longer running, the Host Application will automatically take over the display
 * control.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that when in "Auto" mode, the Extension will receive a {@link Intents#CONTROL_PAUSE_INTENT} when
 * display is off and a {@link Intents#CONTROL_RESUME_INTENT} when the display goes on again.
 * </p>
 * <a name="LEDControl"></a>
 * <h3>Controlling the LEDs</h3>
 * <p>
 * The accessory might have one or more LEDs that are used to notify the user about some event. The
 * Extension can find information about the LEDs for a certain accessory via the registration &
 * capability API.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the accessory has LEDs, the Extension can control them via the Control API. The LEDs can be
 * controlled via the {@link Intents#CONTROL_LED_INTENT}.
 * Note that the Host Application might overtake the control of the LED at any time if it wants to
 * show some important notification to the user, e.g. when the accessory battery level is low.
 * The Extension is happily unaware of this so it might still try to control the LEDs but the Host
 * Application will ignore the calls.
 * </p>
 * <a name="VibratorControl"></a>
 * <h3>Controlling the vibrator</h3>
 * <p>
 * Our accessories might or might not have a vibrator. The Extension can find this out by checking
 * the capabilities of the Host Application via the registration & capability API. If the accessory
 * has a vibrator it is controllable via the Control API, {@link Intents#CONTROL_VIBRATE_INTENT}.
 * </p>
 * <a name="KeyEvents"></a>
 * <h3>Key events</h3>
 * <p>
 * The accessory might have several hardware keys. Your extension will receive the key events when
 * one of the keys is pressed. The {@link Intents#CONTROL_KEY_EVENT_INTENT} is sent to the Extension when
 * a user presses a key on the accessory.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The Intent carries a few parameters, such as the time stamp of the event, the type of event
 * (press, release and repeat) and also the key code. The accessory might have one or more keypads
 * defined. Extensions can look this up in the registration & capabilities API. Each key will have a
 * unique key code for identification. Key codes can be found in the product SDK.
 * </p>
 * <a name="TouchEvents"></a>
 * <h3>Touch events</h3>
 * <p>
 * Certain accessories might have a touch display. Extensions can find this information using the
 * registration & capabilities API. The {@link Intents#CONTROL_TOUCH_EVENT_INTENT} is sent to the
 * Extension when a user taps the accessory display.
 * </p>
 * <a name="DataSending"></a>
 * <h3>Displaying content on the accessory display</h3>
 * <p>
 * Since the Extension is controlling the accessory it also controls what is visible on the display.
 * The content visible to the user comes from the Extension. Basically the Extension sends images to
 * be displayed on the accessory display. To find out the dimensions of the display and the color depth
 * it supports the Extension can use the registration & capabilities API. The
 * {@link Intents#CONTROL_DISPLAY_DATA_INTENT} is sent from the Extension when it wants to update the accessory
 * display. Extensions can also clear the accessory display at any point if they wants to by sending
 * the {@link Intents#CONTROL_CLEAR_DISPLAY_INTENT}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The Extension can send images as raw data (byte array) or it can just send the URI of the image to
 * be displayed. Note that we are using Bluetooth as bearer which means that we canâ€™t send that many
 * frames per second (FPS). Refresh rate of the display can be found in the registration & capabilities API.
 * </p>
